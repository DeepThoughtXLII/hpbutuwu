<p>HP but UWU is a small project that was born from an assignment that I had to complete for a C++ course. 
                        The task was to create a simplefied round-based combat game similar to pokemon with just C++ and the SFML library.
                        I had some pixel art that I had done quickly a while ago and just decided to make use of it for this assignment.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The gameplay is pretty simple. You choose one of three characters and then you fight Voldemort(but uwu). You take alternating turns choosing
                        an action every turn. You have options to Attack(doing damage), Recover(50% to recover HP), Prepare(take less damage next turn) or Cast Magic(do sanity damage).
                        Voldemort(but uwu) will complete a random action every turn with a small chance to do nothing. All actions can be checked in the action log and 
                        every time Voldemort(but uwu) dies, he reaches a new form and the player gains 100 points. When the Player dies, the score gets logged into teh highscore file.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I had a lot of fun with this small project and especially working with C++ was nice. I hadn't done anything in C++ before
                        so it was certainly different, but I enjoyed it immensely once I got immersed in it. I have continued working on the project,
                        now and then just for fun and I still have plans to add small animations and sounds as well as add something for players
                        to input their own names into the highscore file. I have also long been considering a way to progress the character when defeating an enemy.
                        And adding more opponents instead of different versions of Voldemort(but uwu).
